Change Log:

	1/15/18: 	Wrote and tested a UDP client program that can send data
			to the FPGA. I am still having some issues with recieving
			data back from the FPGA. This issue will need to be 
			resolved after the network has been modeled in C.

	1/31/18:	Created a generic convolution function block that can 
			take in an arbitrary size image and filter and produce
			a convolved output. This has only been tested in the 
			context of a bash shell, still needs to be tested on 
			the FPGA.

	2/14/18:	Convolution, RLU, Pool, Fully Connected, and 
			Backpropagation blocks have been developed. The 
			backpropagation block is fairly simple and we are 
			only dealing with a single filter. On every even
			iteration through we get negative values for 
			current test matrix because the filter values go 
			negative and are rectified to zero in the RLU.	
			Need to do more complete testing to see if this
			is a bigger issue or not.
	
	2/19/18:	Project still has issues with variable size image
			and filter values. For now just set constraints on
			these variables.
			When tested on FPGA there is an issue with accessing
			bad addresses. I haven't looked much into what the 
			problem is exactly, but I will look into that before 
			the next commit.
